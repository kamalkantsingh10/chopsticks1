Here is the code that will help you understand how to interface a 1.69 inch screen to raspberry pi. the screen is going to be face of a robotic pet. Can you come up with a code to show various emotions. My current idea is to show a square white dot at the center. its shape/color and minor movement will show emotions. It should be able to move left, right, up, down near the screen boundary when the bot is looking in these directions. I should be able to 1) invoke reactions like 'sad','happy','working','sleeping','angry', normal by calling a functions and pass in parameters 2) move the square dot based on commands look left, right, up down..
